React on Rails Calendar
===================

Simple application that uses React on the front-end and Rails on the back-end. It will allow us to add new events in our calendar, search for them, and edit right there.

Summarizing, the application will behave as follows:

* When the user creates a new record through the horizontal form, it will be appended to the records table
* The user will be able to inline-edit any existing record
* Clicking on any Delete button will remove the associated record from the table
